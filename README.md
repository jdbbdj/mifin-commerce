You can remove this line of code if you want to remove the unneccessary content of each pages.

```
<?php
		while ( have_posts() ) :
			the_post();

			get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', 'page' );

			// If comments are open or we have at least one comment, load up the comment template.
			if ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) :
				comments_template();
			endif;

		endwhile; // End of the loop.
  ?>

```


## Creating your own widget

Creating your own widget is a bit handy in terms of integrating default or customized menus inside of your application. Just simply create a widget inside your functions.php, call an add_function, and call it on the html.

custom-theme-directory
â”œâ”€â”€ functions.php
```
 function custom_footer_widget_one() {
	$args = array(
		'id' => 'footer_widget-col-one',
		'name' => __('Footer Column One', 'text_domain'),
		'description' => __('Column One', 'text_domain'),
		'before_title' => '<h3 class="title">',
		'after_title' => '</h3>',
		'before_widget' => '<div id="1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
		'after_widget' => '</div>'
	);

	register_sidebar($args);
 }

 add_action('widgets_init','custom_footer_widget_one');
```

Create a woocommerce.php file on the root directory of your source code, then add this line of code. Positioning can vary depending on the builder's preference.

## Designing the default templates
Based on my understanding, if I wanted to overwrite the default designs coming from default pages that is generated through Wordpress ***shortcodes***, I can easily just inspect the component's class and design it inside my main.css, as you can see some of the buttons on the login and input fields have been overwritten.
